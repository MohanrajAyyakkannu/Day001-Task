Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

HTTP Stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol.Language of the Web.Protocol used for communication between web browsers and web servers. It's used for Older text-based websites. No additional security features.

HTTPS Stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure. It's used for All modern websites. It Uses SSL certificates for public-key encryption

Textual vs. Binary Format:
    HTTP 1.1 - operates on a textual format.
    HTTP 2 operates on a more efficient binary protocol.
Head-of-Line Blocking:
    HTTP 1.1 experiences head-of-line blocking, delaying subsequent requests.
    HTTP 2 addresses this with multiplexing, enabling concurrent requests and responses.
Multiplexing:
    HTTP 1.1 requires multiple connections for parallel downloads.
    HTTP 2 uses a single connection for parallel downloads, improving efficiency.
Resource Fetching:
    HTTP 1.1 uses resource inlining to fetch multiple pages.
    HTTP 2 introduces PUSH frames, allowing servers to push content without explicit requests.

    
2. Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

In JavaScript, an object is a composite data type that represents a collection of properties, where each property is a key-value pair. Objects are used to organize and store data in a structured format, allowing developers to model real-world entities.

Internal Representation of Objects:

To comprehend how objects are internally represented in JavaScript, it's essential to grasp the concept of key-value pairs. Objects consist of properties, where each property has a name (or key) and a corresponding value. The value can be of any data type, including other objects, functions, or primitive values.

Internally, JavaScript engines use a variety of techniques to implement objects efficiently. One common approach is to use a hash table or a similar data structure. This allows for quick and efficient retrieval of values based on their keys. When you create an object, the JavaScript engine allocates memory to store its properties and values.

Creating Objects:

There are several ways to create objects in JavaScript. The most common method is using object literals, which provide a concise syntax for defining key-value pairs:

Ex:

let car = {
  brand: 'Toyota',
  model: 'Camry',
  year: 2022,
  start: function() {
    console.log('Engine started!');
  }
};


Accessing Properties and Methods:

Accessing properties and methods of an object is straightforward. You can use dot notation or square bracket notation:

console.log(car.brand); // Output: Toyota
console.log(car['model']); // Output: Camry
car.start(); // Output: Engine started!

Objects provide a convenient way to structure and organize data, making code more readable and maintainable.

Prototypes and Inheritance:

JavaScript objects also utilize prototypes for inheritance. Each object in JavaScript is linked to a prototype object, and it inherits properties and methods from that prototype. This allows for a hierarchical structure and the creation of object hierarchies.

Objects are a fundamental building block in JavaScript, providing a flexible and powerful way to structure and organize data.




4. IP address, port, HTTP methods, MAC address

Define port and IP address in simple terms:

A port is a number that identifies a specific process or service on a computer that communicates over a network.

An IP address is a unique number that identifies a computer or device on a network.

Give an example of how port and IP address are used together:

When you visit a website, your browser sends a request to the web server using its IP address and port number. For example, http://127.0.0.1:8080 means that the browser is requesting the web page from the server at IP address 127.0.0.1 and port number 8080

Port Number:

Port numbers are 16-bit numbers, which means they can range from 0 to 65535.

Port numbers are divided into three categories: well-known, registered, and dynamic.

Well-known port numbers are from 0 to 1023 and are reserved for common protocols and services, such as HTTP (80), FTP (21), and SSH (22).

Registered port numbers are from 1024 to 49151 and are assigned to specific protocols and applications by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) or other organizations.

Dynamic port numbers are from 49152 to 65535 and are used by applications that need temporary or random ports for communication.

Explain how port numbers are determined and assigned:
Port numbers are determined by the protocols and applications that use them. For example, HTTP uses port 80 by default, but it can also use other ports if specified.
Port numbers are assigned by the operating system or the application that uses them. For example, when a web server starts, it binds to a port number and listens for incoming requests on that port.
Port numbers can be changed or configured by the user or the administrator. For example, you can change the port number of a web server by editing its configuration file or using a command-line option.

IP Address:

Explain the format and types of IP address:

IP address is the address of the layer-3 IP protocol, which is the main protocol for routing and delivering packets across networks.

There are two versions of IP address: IPv4 and IPv6.

IPv4 address is 32-bit long and consists of four decimal numbers separated by dots, such as 192.168.0.2.
IPv6 address is 128-bit long and consists of eight hexadecimal numbers separated by colons, such as 2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:ff00:0042:7879.

Explain how IP address is assigned and configured:

IP address is assigned by the network administrator or the Internet service provider (ISP) for each computer or device on the network.

IP address can be static or dynamic. Static IP address is fixed and does not change, while dynamic IP address is assigned by a server (such as DHCP) and can change over time.

IP address can be configured manually or automatically. Manual configuration requires the user to enter the IP address and other network settings, such as subnet mask and gateway. 

Automatic configuration uses a protocol (such as DHCP) to obtain the IP address and other network settings from a server.

Explain how IP address is used for communication and routing:

IP address is used to identify the source and destination of each packet on the network.

IP address is used to determine the best path for each packet to reach its destination, based on the routing table and the routing protocols.

IP address is used to handle errors and congestion on the network, by using mechanisms such as ICMP and TCP.

Port and IP address are two essential concepts in computer networking that enable communication and data transfer between computers and devices on a network.

Port is a number that identifies a specific process or service on a computer, while IP address is a number that identifies a computer or device on a network.

Port and IP address are used together to establish connections and send requests and responses between computers and devices on a network.

Provide some suggestions or tips for the readers:

HTTP METHODS:

HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, which is a set of rules that defines how web browsers and web servers communicate over the Internet. HTTP methods are a part of this protocol that specify what action is to be performed on a given resource. For example, when you type a web address in your browser, you are sending a request to the web server using the GET method, which asks for a representation of the resource (usually a web page). Similarly, when you fill out a form on a website, you are sending data to the web server using the POST method, which submits an entity to the resource (usually a database).

There are several HTTP methods, each with a different purpose and effect. Some of the most common ones are:

GET: The GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data and have no other effect on the server.

POST: The POST method submits an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server. For example, creating a new user account, uploading a file, or sending an email.

PUT: The PUT method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload. For example, updating the content of a web page or a user profile.

DELETE: The DELETE method deletes the specified resource. For example, deleting a file, a user account, or a comment.

OPTIONS: The OPTIONS method describes the communication options for the target resource. For example, listing the allowed HTTP methods, the supported formats, or the authentication requirements.

HEAD: The HEAD method asks for a response identical to a GET request, but without the response body. This is useful for checking the status of a resource, such as its availability, size, or last-modified date.

PATCH: The PATCH method applies partial modifications to a resource. For example, changing the title of a blog post or the status of a task.


MAC address:

MAC stands for Media Access Control, which is a sublayer of the data link layer in the network architecture. MAC address is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) for use as a network address in communications within a network segment. A NIC is a hardware device that allows a computer to connect to a network, such as Ethernet, Wi-Fi, or Bluetooth.

Format of MAC Address
To understand what is MAC address is, it is very important that first you understand the format of the MAC Address. So a MAC Address is a 12-digit hexadecimal number (6-bit binary number), which is mostly represented by Colon-Hexadecimal notation.

The First 6 digits (say 00:40:96) of the MAC Address identify the manufacturer, called the OUI (Organizational Unique Identifier). IEEE Registration Authority Committee assigns these MAC prefixes to its registered vendors. 

Here are some OUI of well-known manufacturers:

CC:46:D6 - Cisco 
3C:5A:B4 - Google, Inc.
3C:D9:2B - Hewlett Packard
00:9A:CD - HUAWEI TECHNOLOGIES CO.,LTD

The rightmost six digits represent Network Interface Controller, which is assigned by the manufacturer. 

A MAC address is a 48-bit number, usually represented by six groups of two hexadecimal digits separated by colons or dashes. For example, 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E or 00-1A-2B-3C-4D-5E. The first three groups (or 24 bits) of a MAC address identify the manufacturer of the NIC, called the OUI (Organizational Unique Identifier). The last three groups (or 24 bits) identify the specific NIC within the manufacturer’s range, called the NIC-specific part.

A MAC address is usually assigned by the manufacturer of the NIC and stored in its memory. However, some NICs allow changing the MAC address by software, which is called MAC spoofing. MAC spoofing can be used for various purposes, such as bypassing network access control, impersonating another device, or hiding the identity of a device.

How Do I Find the MAC Address?
A MAC address is mostly used to configure a router for a network device or during troubleshooting. The address of our computer device can be easily checked with any operating device. All the Apple devices connected to our home network contain a unique MAC address. Manufacturers may identify a MAC address by other names, such as the physical address, hardware ID, wireless ID, and Wi-Fi address.

Following are the steps which help to find MAC addresses for different OS

MAC address on Windows
Here is the Step-by-Step guide to finding MAC addresses on Windows.

Command:

ipconfig /all 

MAC address is used to identify devices in the same network. On the other hand, IP Addresses also did the same thing but that is used to identify Device devices globally or through its internet address.

We can't change MAC address, MAC address is a permanent address of a device which is also hardcoded in the Network Interface Card (NIC). However, many drivers allow the MAC address to be changed.
